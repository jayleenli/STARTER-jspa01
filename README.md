# STARTER-jspa01

This is the starter code for JavaScript Programming Assignment jspa01
for the W21 quarter of CMPSC 156.

The assignment instructions can be found here:

# React Rational Calculator

This is the code for the React Rational Calculator lab.

This project was bootstrapped inside the `javascript/` folder
with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The `README.md` file that was created by Create React App is here: [./docs/CreateReactApp-README.md](./docs/CreateReactApp-README.md)

# Almost all files live under `javascript/`

Note that in a pure JavaScript app like this one, it is not usually necessary
to put all of the code inside a `javascript/` directory, *however*, since in 
this course (CMPSC 156) we will eventually be combining a Java backend with a
JavaScript front end, we are establishing a consistent directory convention
right off the bat.   So, apart from the `.github/workflow` directory, and the
top level `README.md`, all files for this project should be under the `javascript` directory.

# Getting Started

Always `cd javascript` before running any of these commands.

* `npm install` installs the necessary packages into `javascript/node_modules`.
  Note that the `javascript/node_modules` directory can be completely deleted
  and rebuilt at any time (deleting it is similar to a `make clean` or `mvn clean` command).
* `npm start` starts up a web server on http://localhost:3000 where you can
  interact with a web page.
* `npm test` runs the unit tests for this project. 

# Setting up GitHub Actions and Codecov.io

The directory `.github/workflows` contains GitHub Actions that can be used to
* Run the test cases for this app
* Check code coverage of this app
* Publish those reports to the website <https://codecov.io> under your GitHub id.

To set this up:
* Login to <https://codecov.io> with you GitHub id.
* Visit the page <https://codecov.io/gh/ucsb-cs156-w21/REPO-NAME-HERE> except change `REPO-NAME-HERE`
  to the name of this repository.

  The `ucsb-cs156-w21` should be kept the same, assuming that you created the repo under
  the class organization.  If, instead, you created it under your own github id, you'll
  need to visit 
  <https://codecov.io/gh/ucsb-cs156-w21/REPO-NAME-HERE> instead.

* On that page, there should be a so-called *upload-token* value, a series of letters and numbers
  like a very long password.   You'll need to copy/paste that value, so keep that window open.

* Visit your repo, go to the Settings tab for the repo (not the Settings tab for your GitHub account)
  and then find `Secrets` in the left navigation, and click on it.

  Or, equivalently, visit the URL <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-w21/YOUR-REPO-NAME-HERE/settings/secrets>

* You should see a `New Secret` button at the upper right.  Click on this, and add a new secret
  called `CODECOV_TOKEN` (must be all uppercase, with underscore).   The value of the secret
  will be the one you found on the `codecov.io` page.

  Adding this token gives your GitHub Action the permission it needs to upload
  code coverage results to <https://codecov.io>.

  If your repo is private, the code coverage results will be also; note that if your
  repo is part of the class organization, then the course staff will also have access
  to your code coverage results, but fellow class members won't (at least not by default.)
  
* To see your code coverage results on <https://codecov.io>, you need to trigger GitHub
  actions to run, either with a push to a branch, or a Pull Request.  Then, by visiting
  the URL <https://codecov.io/gh/ucsb-cs156-w21/REPO-NAME-HERE> you should be able to
  see your code coverage results.
